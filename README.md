<h4> What's spacewar? </h4>

Firstly, its name is not going to be space-war. That's a cheesy, quick name I came up w/ as a placeholder. Like I stressed above, this is a WORK IN PROGRESS!! It currently is a generic-bland old Galaga-like game. 
As I implement more and more features, this will (hopefully) evolve into a more unqiue thing. Here are some of the planned features (all subject to imediate change): 
<ul> 
   <li>Main menu, settings, ship select, customization (ship colors, weapons, extras)<li>
   <li>Unique alien AI and leveling. Mini-bosses and bosses at certain progression points<li>
   <li>Mid game unlockables, stored data <li>
   <li>Local (maybe one day online) multiplayer<li>
   <li>In game power-ups<li>

</ul>
